# 🕵️ CTF 2 – Obfuscation Challenge

## 🎯 Objective

The goal of this CTF is to improve your understanding and practice of various **obfuscation techniques**.

As an attacker, it's essential to understand that applying obfuscation to your **commands or scripts** can help bypass most **traditional antivirus solutions**.  
*(Note: EDRs/XDRs are not in scope here, as they mostly rely on behavioral analysis rather than static signatures.)*

Your mission:  
🔐 **Find the password to the Word document** — it contains the **flag** for this challenge!

You will begin with the following encoded string:

## 🧩 Steps to Follow

You will need to perform **5 deobfuscation steps** to fully retrieve the cleartext content.  
Understanding each transformation is **part of the challenge**.

> 💡 **Tip**: Try to solve it **without using ChatGPT** to simulate a realistic attacker mindset.  
> Everything else (scripts, tools, Google, etc.) is allowed! 😊
