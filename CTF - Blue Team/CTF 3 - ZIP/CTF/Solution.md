## 🧩 Solution Steps

**Step 1:** Unzip the Excel file  
> Excel files (`.xlsx`) are actually ZIP archives. You can unzip them using any archive tool or the `unzip` command.

**Step 2:** Browse through the extracted file structure  
> You'll find folders like `_rels`, `docProps`, and `xl`.

**Step 3:** Open the `xl` directory, then open the file `sharedStrings.xml`  
> This file stores most of the textual content used in the workbook.

**Step 4:** Retrieve the flag  
> The flag is hidden in the XML content. You should find it inside one of the `<t>` tags.

🎉 **The flag is:**  
Z1P_M@$73r3d
