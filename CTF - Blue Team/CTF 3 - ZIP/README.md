# 📦 CTF 3 – ZIP (Excel File Recovery Challenge)

## 📝 Description

The objective of this CTF is to deepen your understanding of the **internal structure of document files** such as Excel, Word, or PowerPoint (in this case, an Excel file).  
It's not uncommon to receive a seemingly corrupted document file. Through this challenge, you'll learn a method to **recover content** even if the file has been damaged.

⚠️ **Note:** This method does not work in all situations, but it's a valuable technique to know.
