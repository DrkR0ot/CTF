# 🕵️‍♂️ CTF - OSINT: The Art of Finding Without Exploiting

Dive into the fascinating world of **OSINT (Open Source Intelligence)**, where your most powerful weapon isn’t an exploit, but **publicly available information**.

In these challenges, there's no need for shells or brute force.  
Everything you need is already online — scattered across social media, photos, metadata, domain names, or web history.

---

## 🔍 Your Mission

Reconstruct events, uncover identities, locate places, or expose hidden narratives using **only open-source information** available on the web.

---

## 🧠 These CTFs will teach you how to:

- Use search engines like a power user  
- Read between the lines of public profiles  
- Leverage OSINT tools such as **Sherlock**, **theHarvester**, or **ExifTool**  
- Understand the real-world impact of a poorly managed digital footprint  

🎯 Perfect for learning to think like an investigator…  
or like an attacker who touches nothing, but sees everything.
