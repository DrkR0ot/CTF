# 🔁 CTF - Password Mutation: Humans, My Favorite Weakness

Users change their passwords... but rarely their logic.  
In this challenge, you’re placed in a realistic situation: you have access to an old password and must guess or crack the new one by identifying **common mutation patterns**.

🔐 Added digits, capital letters, modified years, predictable suffixes...  
Bad habits often become an attacker’s best ally.

---

## 🧠 Objective

Understand and exploit **human patterns in password changes** to gain access to a locked account.

## ❓ Why This Challenge?

### For an Attacker

Password mutation is a powerful technique:
- It helps bypass systems that enforce periodic password changes.
- It relies on understanding **user behavior**, not just brute force.
- It’s often faster than traditional attacks — especially when a base password is already known.

---

### For a Blue Team

This type of scenario reveals **behavioral vulnerabilities**:
- Train users not to recycle or slightly mutate their old passwords.
- Implement systems that **detect similarities** with previously used passwords.
- Enforce **MFA (Multi-Factor Authentication)** to reduce the risk of compromise.

🎯 A great challenge to highlight that the biggest risk often doesn’t come from the machine…  
but from the human using it.
