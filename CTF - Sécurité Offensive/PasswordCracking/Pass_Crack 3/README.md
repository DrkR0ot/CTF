# 🧠💥 CTF - The Labyrinth of Secrets: The Password Hell

Welcome to a challenge as improbable as it is terrifying: a system where **every password is a vulnerability** and **every user is a riddle**.

- 💾 Poorly secured databases  
- 📎 Badly formatted files  
- 💬 Clues left in random notes  

In this CTF, your mission is simple: **crack, guess, recover, reformat — over and over again —** until you uncover the full chain of **human and technical failures**... and reach the ultimate **master flag**.

---

## 🎯 Objective

Put all your knowledge to the test — from general logic to advanced **password cracking tools**.

---

## 🔍 This challenge will test you with:

- Classic dictionary attacks  
- `zip2john`, `hashcat`, `john`  
- Your **Linux skills**  
- Your understanding of **file formats and extensions**

---

## ⚠️ Disclaimer

**High difficulty level**

🧩 This is an absurd, hilarious, and intentionally **unrealistic** CTF.  
But you'll have fun — and probably learn a lot.
