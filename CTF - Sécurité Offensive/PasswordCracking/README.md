# 🔐 CTF - Password Cracking: Breaking the First Line of Defense

Passwords are often the key to accessing a system… and sometimes its greatest weakness.  
In these challenges, you'll be tasked with identifying, extracting, and cracking passwords from hash files or protected archives.

💥 Whether through dictionary attacks, brute force, or rainbow tables, you’ll learn how to exploit weak or poorly stored passwords to gain access.

🛠️ Common tools: `John the Ripper`, `Hashcat`, `rockyou.txt`, `hydra`, `zip2john`, `fcrackzip`, etc.

## ❓ Why These Challenges?

### From an Attacker’s Perspective

**Password cracking is often a critical step:**
- It allows initial access or privilege escalation.
- It may expose reused passwords across multiple services.
- It exploits user negligence: simple passwords, plaintext storage, weak hashing algorithms.

### From a Blue Team Perspective

**These exercises are just as important for defenders. Understanding attack methods helps you:**
- Strengthen password policies (length, complexity, rotation).
- Detect and prevent brute force attacks (through logs, alerts, rate limiting).
- Regularly audit hash databases to spot weak or compromised passwords.

🎯 **In short:**  
Learning how to crack a password helps you understand how to better protect it.
