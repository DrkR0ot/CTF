# 🔓 CTF - Privilege Escalation 3  
## ⏰ Privilege Escalation via Cron Job

In this challenge, you’ll discover how a **misconfigured cron job** can become a security vulnerability.  
Starting with limited user access, your goal is to take advantage of a script automatically executed by the system to escalate privileges and gain access to **User3**, who improperly configured a scheduled task.

---

## 🔎 Objective

⚠️ This scenario demonstrates how **automation can become dangerous** if implemented without proper permission control or best practices.

---

## 💡 Why This Challenge?

🧠 A great hands-on situation to learn how to **identify and secure scheduled tasks** in a Linux environment.

## 🛠️ How to Reproduce Locally

If you'd like to reproduce this CTF on your own machine, you have two options:

1. **On Windows**: Use **Docker Desktop**  
2. **On Linux**: Run the commands as **root** and copy/paste those from the `Dockerfile`  
   ⚠️ Be sure to fully understand what each command does before executing it!
