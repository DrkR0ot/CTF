# 🔓 CTF - Privilege Escalation 4  
## 🧬 Privilege Escalation via Combined Misconfigurations

In this challenge, you'll need to chain multiple privilege escalation steps caused by **cumulative misconfigurations**: excessive permissions, poorly protected **files**, vulnerable scripts...

🎯 Your ultimate goal?  
Add your own user to `/etc/passwd` with UID 0, becoming a **stealth root user** — invisible at first glance.

---

## 🔎 Objective

⚠️ This scenario shows how seemingly minor security issues, when combined, can lead to **full system compromise**.

---

## 💡 Why This Challenge?

🔍 A perfect opportunity to learn how to think like an attacker — and more importantly, like a **proactive defender**.

---

## 🛠️ How to Reproduce Locally

If you'd like to reproduce this CTF on your own machine, here are two options:

1. **On Windows**: Use **Docker Desktop**  
2. **On Linux**: Run the commands as **root** and copy/paste those from the provided `Dockerfile`  
   ⚠️ Be sure to fully understand what each command does before running them!

**Good luck, and have fun! 🎉**
