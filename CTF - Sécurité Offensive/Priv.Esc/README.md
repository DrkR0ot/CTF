# 🔓 CTF - Privilege Escalation: From the Shadows to Root

You’ve gained initial access? Great. But that’s just the beginning.

---

## 🎯 The Attacker’s Goal

Go from a limited user to full system control.

In these challenges, you’ll learn how to exploit:
- Misconfigurations
- Incorrectly assigned permissions
- Vulnerable SUID binaries
- Abusable cron jobs
- Poorly protected scripts

...all to escalate privileges and become **root**.

🛠️ A critical step for any pentester — because initial access means nothing without escalation.  
💡 These scenarios show how a seemingly minor misstep can become a critical vulnerability in the wrong hands.

## ❓ Why These Challenges?

These challenges help you understand how attackers move once they’ve landed inside a system.

### For Blue Teams, they are essential to:

- 🔍 Identify the most common privilege escalation vectors  
- 🧱 Fix misconfigurations before they’re exploited  
- 📊 Enforce and audit least privilege policies  
- 🛑 Detect suspicious behaviors (e.g. sensitive binary execution, editing `/etc/passwd`, etc.)

---

🎯 In short: mastering privilege escalation techniques teaches you where attackers might hide —  
so you can stop them before they strike.
